# Supply Chain Security Gateway

A reference architecture and proof of concept implementation of a supply chain security gateway with the goal of enforcing sane security policies to an organization's consumption of 3rd party software in its own products.

## TL;DR

Start the services using `docker-compose`

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify all the services are active

```
docker-compose ps
```

Use the gateway using the `demo-client`

```
cd demo-client && ./gradlew assemble --refresh-dependencies
```

At this point, you should see logs generated by gateway and the policy decision service.

```
docker-compose logs envoy
docker-compose logs pdp
```

## Architecture

### Data Plane Flow

TODO

## Usage

If you are developing on any of the service and want to force re-create the containers with updated image:

```
docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d
```

### PDP Development

Build and run the PDP using:

```
cd services && make
GLOBAL_CONFIG_PATH=../config/global.yml PDP_POLICY_PATH=../policies ./out/pdp-server
```

PDP listens on `0.0.0.0:9000`. To use the host instance of PDP, edit `config/envoy.yml` and set the address of the `ExtAuthZ` plugin to your host network address.
